Homework 7 
Due: Sunday, April 10 
1. Recall in the setting of MANOVA the treatment SSP B = Σgl=1 nl(¯xl − ¯x)(¯xl − ¯x)> and n = Σgl=1 nl. Let 1m (resp. 0m) be the m dimensional vector with all entries equal to 1 (resp. 0).
(a) Let
A = diag(n1, ..., ng−1) − n/1 (n1, ..., ng−1)> (n1, ..., ng−1),
where diag(n1, ..., ng−1) is the diagonal matrix with entries n1, ..., ng−1. Show that A is positive definite.
(b) Let P = A−1/2 and define the (g − 1) × n matrix

Let Q = P(Z − n/1(n1, ..., ng−1) T 1Tn) be an (g − 1) × n matrix. Show that the rows of Q are orthonormal, i.e. QQT = Ig−1.
(c) Recall the data matrix

such that al代 写Math 3018 Homework 7
代做程序编程语言l rows are mutually independent and xlji.i.d. ∼ Np(µl, Σ), j = 1, ..., nl. Let Y = QX. Show that the columns of Y> are mutually independent with distribution Np(˜µl, Σ), l = 1, ..., g − 1, where ˜µlis the lth column of the matrix
(n1(µ1 − µ), ..., ng−1(µg−1 − µ))PT.
(d) Show that B = YT Y . Hint: Use the Sherman–Morrison formula you proved in HW1 for A−1 and note that Σgl=1 nl(¯xl − ¯x) = 0.
(e) Under H0 : µ1 = · · · = µg = µ, conclude B ∼ Wp(g − 1, Σ).
2. Problems from the textbook by Johnson and Wichern: 6.23, 6.31, 7.6, 7.8, 7.25.
